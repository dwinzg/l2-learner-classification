You can discuss how they relate to your assumptions about differences, what you saw in the texts (if you looked at some), or any statistical analyses you did to help identify features. You will lose points here if there is no rational basis for your selection of features.**"

Though it is not necessary that every group member has an equal contribution in terms of code, every group member should have a significant contribution, a major part of the lab for which they were a primary contributor. If any team member fails to contribute significantly, the rest of the group, assuming they have made efforts to encourage the team member to contribute, should discuss what happened in the report, otherwise all team members might lose the raw points for this rubric. Team members who failed to contribute may lose some or all of their grade for the assignment.  Make sure to also outline how code review was performed.  This should be similar to your weekly teamwork reports.**"

It might be that the examples look like L1 English (and thus are difficult to determine the L1), or it might be that they heavily influence one of your features incorrectly.  You should provide 3 misclassified examples from each class.  Your hypothesis can address each example individually, or it can generalize over multiple examples.**"
